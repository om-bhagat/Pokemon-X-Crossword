 Generates a new 20Ã—20 crossword grid daily

 Supports horizontal and vertical word placement

 Automatically fills unused cells with black squares

 How It Works
Puzzle Generation

Run node generatePuzzle.js

Selects up to 30 random PokÃ©mon words from the word bank

Places them randomly on a 20Ã—20 grid (avoiding overlaps)

Fills the remaining unused cells as black squares

Outputs puzzle to daily-puzzle.json

Frontend Rendering

script.js reads from daily-puzzle.json

Dynamically builds an interactive crossword interface

Allows users to input answers and check them with color-coded feedback
